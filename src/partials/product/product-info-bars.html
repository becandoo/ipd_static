                                <p> Upgrading the engine management software and exhaust on your turbo Volvo is the most effective
                                    way to improve output. You can expect to see realistic and measurable gains from 33 to
                                    53 HP depending on the model. Since 1994 we have partnered exclusively with MTE SWEDEN
                                    to bring you the world¹s most effective and reliable upgrades. We work with engineers
                                    from MTE to develop performance calibrations optimized for the North American market
                                    that retain full factory functionality, drivability and emission levels.</p>
                                <p> If you spend much time on popular Volvo performance enthusiast forums, you might have noticed
                                    that we are occasionally referred to as being too conservative in our tuning since some
                                    Volvo tuners publish higher horsepower specs than we do. Some of our competitors do make
                                    a couple of more peak HP, but if you do your homework, you will find that our upgrades
                                    provide superior real world performance and the reason is because we focus on developing
                                    the most area under the power curve with smooth linear power delivery.</p>
                                <h2> Still not convinced?</h2>
                                <p> It's our goal to provide you with software upgrades that deliver maximum power levels as
                                    advertised as well as being reliable without overstressing the car¹s powertrain. It might
                                    be possible to squeeze a few more ponies from certain models by running a bit more boost,
                                    but careful research and development combined with 20 years of experience in upgrading
                                    the Volvo 5 and 6-cylinder Turbo models have made our upgrades the most respected and
                                    successful in the industry.</p>
                                <h2> Stage Zero?</h2>
                                <p> When upgrading, it seems logical that you would want to make sure that the engine is in top
                                    tune, but this is often overlooked in the quest for instant performance gratification,
                                    which often results in poor performance from your upgrades. The increased loads can cause
                                    misfiring and other unpleasant issues. We ran across the Stage "ZERO" idea on volvospeed.com
                                    and concur 100% that you should perform these steps before making upgrades to the engine
                                    in your Volvo if it is more than 5 years old or has more than 50,000 miles on it.</p>

                                    direct flash tuning method had one drawback, it required our customers to send their
                                    ECU to us for upgrading, which put their car out of commission for 2-3 days and also
                                    added $150 to $200 in overnight shipping fees to the upgrade cost. We wanted to provide
                                    a solution that allowed our customers to experience the superior performance of our upgrade
                                    without the inconvenience and additional cost of sending their ECU to us. So began the
                                    quest to develop the solution that we are ready to release for sale.</p>
                                <p> The basic details are as follows:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Our new Softloader hardware allows you to flash our software upgrades directly into your
                                        car using the OBD II diagnostic port for access in about 10-15 minutes.</li>

                                    <strong>XP based (Vista and Windows 7 not supported)</strong>. If you don't have an e-mail
                                        account, our software files can be transferred by disc.
                                        <u>Please note that the softloader must remain connected to the laptop /PC during the
                                            file transfer process . </u><br> The Softloader upgrade comes supplied with cables
                                        that terminate with USB on one end and OBD II on the other. In between will be a
                                        communication / adapter device that allows your PC to communicate with your Volvo.</li>
                                    <li> The hardware is driven by a free software interface that you can download from our website
                                        and is also included on CD with the hardware.</li>
                                    <li> The hardware can be used on multiple cars, so you’ll only need to purchase the software
                                        for each additional car after the initial purchase.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    first step of the upgrade process is to read the software and hardware details from your
                                    car and then forward those files to us so we can provide you with calibrations developed
                                    specifically for your car. We realize that this may sound cumbersome, compared to some
                                    other similar solutions currently available (where this step is skipped). There is a
                                    significant difference in performance that comes from our method, and that is why we
                                    have developed this superior solution.</p>
                                <p> Once we receive data from your car, we can usually provide 2-3 day turn around on the creation
                                    of the performance calibrations specific to your model, and return these back to you
                                    via e-mail to be loaded into your Volvo’s ECU. We could bypass this step and provide
                                    a more generic tune for the base engine family, but our testing has proven that our wide
                                    scope calibration method provides the ultimate in long-term, trouble free performance.</p>

            <p>Please see vehicle application tab for specific vehicle fitments.</p>
            <p>The base software interface is a very simple menu driven application developed for ease of use.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the softloader application on your PC,</li>
                <li>Plug the cable into the OBD connector on your car and the system will guide you through the brief process
                    with clear, easy to understand screen prompts.</li>
                <li>We have also developed fully functional scan tool software that allows you to read and reset check engine
                    codes as well as providing access to other diagnostic information from the ABS system, the climate control
                    system, safety systems etc. The diagnostic software includes a cross reference database that provides
                    a detailed description of the OBD II generic codes as well as the Volvo specific codes. Only top of the
                    line pro level scan tools costing upwards of $2500 have this capability.</li>
                <li>We also developed data logging software that allows you to select from multiple OBD II monitored inputs and
                    enhanced outputs such as boost, intake charge temp, ignition angle, knock sensor activity, etc that standard
                    OBD scanners can not access. These inputs can be displayed in real time or recorded to a file for later
                    playback.</li>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ToggleElement('faq_13');" title="Click to Expand or collapse answer">We have several Volvos in our family, do we need to purchase softloaders for each car?</a>
            <div
                id="faq_13" style="display:none;" class="faqitem">
                <p>No. You’ll only need to purchase the software upgrade file for each car. The hardware is locked to a single
                    car, but when a file for a second car is purchased, the cable will become functional for both cars. The
                    files themselves are encrypted and serialized to limit functionality to only the car it was written for
                    based on the initial read out process and is also cross checked against Volvos immobilizer coding which
                    is unique to each model.</p>

</li>
<li><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ToggleElement('faq_14');" title="Click to Expand or collapse answer">What's going to happen to my factory warranty?</a>
    <div
        id="faq_14" style="display:none;" class="faqitem">
        <p>Bottom line, we don't want you to get the impression that there is no risk involved. These types of upgrades produce
            significant power increases and depending on how hard you drive your car, there could be reductions in the longevity
            of drive train components. It is possible that if you had a situation arise where a major drive train part failed,
            Volvo could deny coverage. The way US laws are written, your rights to use after market parts and upgrades on
            your car are protected by the Magnusson Moss act, but it is not a guarantee of warranty coverage. Basically the
            act states that you have a right to use non-original parts on your car and still retain the factory warranty.
            However, if there is a failure and the manufacturer (VOLVO in this case) can show that the failure was caused
            by the non-original part, they can deny coverage.</p>
        <p>The important thing is that your dealer cannot VOID your warranty just because the part is on the car. We have heard
            of cases where a dealer would tell a customer that their car had no warranty because it had an after market exhaust.
            Granted, the exhaust is not covered, however the rest of the car is still under the normal warranty. The last
            thing we want for you to experience is a serious engine or drive train problem and we have designed our upgrades
            with this in mind. It is easy to get more power by running at higher boost levels, but extensive testing has
            shown that longevity quickly drops and drive train components are overloaded. For most Volvo owners, the Volvo
            is also the family's main vehicle. Volvo owners also rate longevity as one of the main reasons they bought their
            Volvo. We'd like to keep it that way. If you have more questions about this, please visit the link below.</p>

<li><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ToggleElement('faq_15');" title="Click to Expand or collapse answer">What are the effects on long term durability?</a>
    <div
        id="faq_15" style="display:none;" class="faqitem">
        <p>As we mentioned above, your driving style and maintenance practices have the biggest effect on this. We've been offering
            these upgrades since 1994. We know of one case where a customer bent a connecting rod while drag racing the car.
            This car was also running with the waste gate adjusted beyond the factory spec. We have heard from customers
            that have over 200,000 miles of service since making the upgrades on their early 850 turbos with no drive train
            problems. Our experience shows that you should get normal service from your car by keeping the engine oil, spark
            plugs and transmission oil fresh. Details are included with the ECU upgrade. Also, keep in mind that the amount
            of time that your car sees full throttle loading where the upgraded calibrations are most noticeable is relatively
            small in comparison to the relative life of the car.</p>
        </div>
</li>
<li><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ToggleElement('faq_16');" title="Click to Expand or collapse answer">What's going to happen to my fuel economy?</a>
    <div
        id="faq_16" style="display:none;" class="faqitem">
        <p>Again, this depends on your driving habits. If you're a lead foot you're going to use a lot more gas. If you are
            making more power, you are using more fuel. Typically we find that most customers will notice a slight drop in
            economy for the first week or two when they are playing with the new power, but economy should return to within
            a mile or two per gallon of what you've been getting. When cruising on a long trip in a situation where you might
            use the cruise control, fuel economy will usually be the same as stock. Generally speaking, most of the ECU calibrations
            for the upgrade software are only accessed when the throttle pedal is at over 60% input, so most of the time
            you are operating on the factory calibrations unless you have your foot in it!</p>
        </div>
</li>
<li><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ToggleElement('faq_17');" title="Click to Expand or collapse answer">Can the performance software be detected during normal service and diagnostic procedures?</a>
    <div
        id="faq_17" style="display:none;" class="faqitem">
        <p>No. A technician would have to temporarily install a boost gauge and drive the car under load to see that it was
            operating at a higher boost levels than stock. Very unlikely, but possible. One way to avoid this would be to
            use your softloader to flash the car back to stock whenever it is in for dealer service. There have been concerns
            about whether or not Volvo would be able to see a log record showing file transfers. This is visible to Volvo,
            but it is not information that can be used to determine if the car has been modified. The reason this is not
            an indicator of modification is that Volvo had to open up access under federal law to allow independent service
            shops to load software drivers into the cars, which is necessary when replacing network components such as power
            window switches, electronic throttle modules etc.</p>
        </div>
</li>
<li><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ToggleElement('faq_18');" title="Click to Expand or collapse answer">What happens if my Volvo Dealer updates or over writes the performance software in my ECU for some reason?</a>
    <div
        id="faq_18" style="display:none;" class="faqitem">
        <p>This is possible, but not very likely. Usually it takes a major software recall for this to be a concern. If it does
            happen, you can re-flash the car with your upgraded calibration file, however we recommend that you contact us
            first with information on why the car was flashed by the dealer as it may be a desirable improvement that we
            would like to integrate into our base upgrade. Depending on the nature of the factory re-flash, we may have a
            short delay before we integrate the factory update into our performance calibrations. This is usually only a
            concern on cars that are 1-2 years old as most factory software upgrades occur during this time.</p>
        </div>
</li>
<li><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ToggleElement('faq_19');" title="Click to Expand or collapse answer">Is it possible for the software to become corrupt, revert back to stock or a lower output level on it's own?</a>
    <div
        id="faq_19" style="display:none;" class="faqitem">
        <p>No. Occasionally we get calls from customers that are experiencing reduced power after several months or years of
            upgraded performance. The software does not go bad! Usually what we find is that a peripheral component such
            as the Turbo Control Valve (TCV) or Mass Air Flow (MAF) Meter is failing and providing intermittent performance.
            Worn spark plugs is another common problem. The higher boost levels can dramatically shorten the life expectancy
            of the spark plugs, especially if the car is tracked, dyno'd or subjected to towing at or near the max GVW rating
            for extended durations. When spark plugs get badly worn, the ignition can misfire under load and performance
            will be reduced to a level that prevents the mis-firing. BTW, we highly recommend the use of Irridium plugs when
            running an upgrade ECU. We stock Iridiums for most Volvo applications) We've also seen a few fuel pumps that
            did not provide proper output on high loads, these will usually register a diagnostic trouble code, but can sometimes
            be right on the border of not providing enough fuel for high output operation, but plenty of fuel under normal
            loads. These are rare instances, but the point is that the software does not degrade over time. If you are experiencing
            reduced performance, it is because the car has either been flashed back to stock by your dealer or there is an
            issue with engine management hardware. Faulty or intermittent sticking of the TCV is the #1 cause of reduced
            or sporadic fluctuations in performance.</p>
        </div>
</li>
<li><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ToggleElement('faq_20');" title="Click to Expand or collapse answer">Other tuners alter the throttle mapping and market it as a performance improvement. Does the ipd/MTE upgrade offer this feature?</a>
    <div
        id="faq_20" style="display:none;" class="faqitem">
        <p>Some Volvo tuners provide very aggressive “throttle mapping” that makes the car feel snappy off the line, but this
            also makes it very difficult to control the throttle in low traction / low speed maneuvers. Throttle mapping
            does not improve performance, it simply increases the rate of throttle plate opening in relation to how far the
            throttle pedal is pressed. For example let’s assume that the stock throttle mapping is linear, so when the throttle
            pedal is pressed half way down, the throttle plate is open half way. Aggressive throttle mapping alters this
            so that ¼ throttle equals ½ throttle plate opening and 1/2 throttle pedal input opens the throttle plate 100%.
            Throttle pedal movement from ½ to full does nothing! The throttle becomes very touchy and difficult to control
            in some situations. Initially you may get the feeling that the car has more power as it jumps out from under
            you when you barely touch the throttle, but it becomes tiring real fast. Even Volvo used this tactic to make
            the under powered 5 cylinder XC90 feel like it had a bigger engine, but owners complained so much that Volvo
            offered free reflashes with more linear throttle mapping. We do revise throttle mapping to provide smooth linear
            power delivery that is useable and controllable.</p>
        </div>
</li>
<li><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ToggleElement('faq_21');" title="Click to Expand or collapse answer">Does ipd offer Hi Octane mapping for use when running 92-93 octane fuel?</a>
    <div
        id="faq_21" style="display:none;" class="faqitem">
        <p>Yes. And it is included in each and every one of our upgrades absolutely free! Some tuners offer low octane tunes
            and charge more for a high octane tune and sell them separately. This is the result of narrow scope tuning. It
            is much easier and cost effective to develop a tune that works well within a narrow range of octane levels. It’s
            much more involved and time consuming to develop calibrations that allow the engine management system to operate
            safely across a wide range of octane levels using factory algorithms like we do. Our upgrades will provide maximum
            safe performance on 89-93 octane fuel. There is no need to have two different programs or limit the flexability
            of your performance by having to choose a low octane or hi octane tune. </p>
        <p>Granted, when operating on our wide scope calibrations the engine management system will adjust the amount of torque
            and HP developed when running on a lower octane fuel, but performance will always be in accordance to the fuel
            quality available within the range of commonly available pump fuels. The BOSCH ME7 and ME9 engine management
            systems that Volvo uses have excellent ignition management algorithms that allow us to provide optimum performance
            and reliability across a wide range of fuels and load conditions.</p>
        <p>Our wide scope tuning also allows the engine management system to adapt to additional air flow improving upgrades
            such as a larger downpipe, sport exhaust or air intake system. Gross changes to the air flow, such as that provided
            by a turbo upgrade do require custom calibrations, which we do have available for some models.</p>

                    <p>from the time i ordered the product to the time i got my file back from ipd took about 2 weeks. i have
                        IPDs R style boost gauge installed on my 2004 S60 R manual. stock i was at about 14 psi on boost.
                        after the upgrade i am now at 21 psi boost. wow what a difference in the way the car accelerates.
                        Thanks ipd!</p>

                <p>If you have a 2004-2005 S60R Geartronic with out this software upgrade that means you have not a S60R. I
                    upgrade my 2004 S60R Geartronic with Stage 1 today without any modifications with stock exhaust difference
                    is incredible. I suggest everybody that wants to use real S60R with 5 speed Geartronic. Thanks all IPD
                    team a lot.</p>

                <p>This product is by far the best bang for your buck, and boy does it make a huge difference. Car pulls faster
                    and earlier and seems to come alive. turbo spools quicker and louder. Without question worth every penny.
                    If you have an R then stop missing out on what the car was meant to be like!!</p>

                - "RP" from MA</span>
                <p>Great Product! The Software Package pretty much paid for itself by helping me track down an intermittent
                    Thermostat &amp; Thermal Sensor problem. But the real winner is the ECU upgrade. Instructions were complex
                    but fairly easy to follow, and the response on my 2001 S60 T5 with manual transmission was immediately
                    noticeable. Turbo spools up fast and there's very strong acceleration at mid to high revs. Below 2000
                    RPM the engine bogs down, especially in higher gears (should not be a problem with an automatic if the
                    kick-down is quick enough), but once the tach hits 2001 RPM with the right foot planted, it feels like
                    a JATO rocket lit up back there. And keeping up with or passing traffic, even on steep uphills, is a
                    breeze. Fuel economy did not suffer, maybe even improved slightly. With the IPD Softloader you get the
                    best of both worlds: 4 cylinder economy in daily driving, with a big-six power just a toe-poke away.</p>

                <p>Wow. What a difference! Loaded the stage 2 software into my '04 V70R (manual trans.), and with the iPd air
                    management system and exhaust downleader I now have a sleeper of a Corvette killer. This is how they
                    should have rolled out of the factory! The upgrades were worth every penny. Thank You Thank You, iPd!</p>

                <p>If you don't have Ipd's softloader you are really denying your Volvo the satisfaction it deserves. This is
                    my 2nd S60 (first one 2.5t current R) and Ken did an amazing job with the stage 2 tune. Volvo's are very
                    tamed when stock but the boys and girls at Ipd help unleash the amazingness with the softloader. YOU
                    NEED THIS!!!!!! IPD ROCKS!!!</p>

                - "AK" from NEW MEXICO</span>
                <p>What an amazing upgrade. I was pleased to receive the custom stageII softloader program for my car within
                    24 hrs! I just completed the upgrade process which was explained in the instructions perfectly. First
                    startup was flawless in fact it seems like nothing has changed. Warmed it up and took it out on the street
                    for the moment of truth. Now we learn that things have changed dramatically! Boost builds much faster
                    and my boost gauge confirmed this all the way up to about 1.5 bar! Thats over 21 psi! My car is an '04
                    V70R manual trans with a few supporting mods like a front mount intercooler kit, high flow air filter,
                    IPD's "R" intake, and 3" turbo back exhaust system. Thanks for the help putting the finishing touch on
                    this high performance Volvo!</p>

                - "BM" from North Oaks, Minnesota</span>
                <p>It has been 30+ years since I last "tweaked" a vehicle. I choose the Volvo C30 over many Japanese cars because
                    I wanted something different and because I love Volvo's. My goal is a "sleeper Mustang GT killer". The
                    IPD Softloader upgrade/flash has not let me down. What a difference in performance! My C30 was already
                    fun to drive but now it is just a hoot and hard to keep your foot out of the gas. I'm still breaking
                    in the engine but look out after the Bell Intercooler, KN Typhoon intake, the exhaust from TME of Sweden
                    and more miles on the car. Using the software was pretty straight forward and about what I am used to
                    in flashing hundreds of vehicles with my employer. It is the best money spent for the horsepower and
                    torque gained.</p>

                - "ATC" from ALBANY CALIFORNIA</span>
                <p>I did extensive research and it came down between the Elevate hand-held programmer or the IPD system. I Chose
                    the IPD as it was several hundred dollars cheaper (with Code Reading, mutli-grade fuel, etc.). Ultimately
                    the IPD upgrade changed the character of the car dramatically and driving is an entirely new experience.
                    I simply can not believe that the factory had the car de-tuned in such a performance-robbing way. WOW.
                    Hands-down the most "bang for the buck"; seems like a lot of money however is worth every cent. The whole
                    procedure took a little more than one week (northern California). Thank you for reading. 2008 Volvo C70

                - "BG" from Hayward California</span>
                <p>I just loaded the Softloader on my C30 and what a difference! This is how the car should have come from the
                    factory. It got rid of the flat spot around 2800 rpm. The car now pulls like it is several hundred pounds
                    lighter. It is noticeable even in non- spirited driving. The hardest part was waiting the approximately
                    18 minutes for the program to load. Another great product from ipd.</p>

                - "GR" from North Little Rock, Arkansas</span>
                <p>Best bang for the buck and I didn't have to get my hands dirty! Thanks IPD for a product that brought new
                    life to my Volvo and Ken for the great tech support! Been a IPD customer from 1974!</p>

                - "DM" from New York</span>
                <p>The car builds boost quicker, much quicker and stronger. I did a test last night highway driving you can
                    see a noticeable increase in gas mileage.<br><br>Step on it hard though and it will suck it down : )<br><br>Great
                    upgrade IPD, car should have been like this since day 1!!!</p>

                - "J" from San Antonio, TX</span>
                <p>I picked this up about a month ago and wow, the difference is quite noticeable! There are a few options for
                    my car (S60 T5) as far as re-tuning the car goes, but none of the offerings are as robust as this one
                    (code reading/clearing/resetting, data logging). That, and the support provided by iPd is exceptional.
                    All in all, I'm quite pleased with this tune!<br><br>FWIW, the data logger provides the following info
                    (in realtime as well as to a CSV):<br><br>Pedal position (%) Engine Speed (RPM) Vehicle Speed (MPH) Engaged
                    Gear Boost Pressure (PSI) Charge Air Temp (F) Air/Fuel Ratio<br><br>For the money (especially at the
                    newly reduced price), this is a great product/bundle.</p>

                    had problem with reading car's data by my computer the other computer just did the work. thanks God for
