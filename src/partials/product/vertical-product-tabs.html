                <h2>Potential Product Fitment Issues</h2>
                <p>140, 164, 1800 and 240/260 owners will need to check which brand rear calipers your car is equipped with.
                    These pads only work with ATE branded calipers.</p>
                <p>There is no way to know for sure what calipers are on your car without visual inspection. It is very common
                    on these older cars for the original calipers to have been replaced by a different brand. We've even
                    seen cars with mismatched left and right branded calipers (which take different pads.)</p>
                <p>Fits all 740/760/780 models that do not have Independent Rear Suspension</p>
                <p>Fits all 940/960 models that do not have Independent Rear Suspension</p>
                <p>Fits FWD (Front Wheel Drive) S70 &amp; V70 models 1998-2000 (does NOT fit AWD models)</p>

                    <p>These pads were a perfect fit into my Volvo ATE rear calipers. The last set of the same pads lasted about
                        50K miles and worked well. I'll be back again the next time I need rear brake pads. These are great!</p>

                    <h2> Does IPD offer free shipping?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> We offer free shipping for most orders totalling over $175 where the shipping destination is within the
                        contiguous&nbsp;United States (Lower 48 states excluding Alaska &amp; Hawaii.) &nbsp;A few products
                        are excluded from this option. &nbsp;We will use an economical low priority shipping method. &nbsp;You
                        must select the Free Economy Shipping option during checkout. &nbsp;</p>
                    <h2> Shipping Quotes</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> We get lots of emails asking us to quote freight.&nbsp; It is much faster if you do it yourself by using
                        the real-time freight calculator on our website.&nbsp;&nbsp; We offer a shipping calculator on every
                        product page, on the shopping cart summary page and during checkout.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2> How long does it take to get my parts?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> This really depends on whether the item is in stock and&nbsp;what shipping method you choose. &nbsp;if
                        your order is complete and ready to ship, we typically ship it by the next working day. See the freight
                        calculator on the website for transit times.</p>
                    <h2> When do you ship my parts?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Like above, this depends on whether the items are in stock. We ship orders Monday-Friday during our normal
                        business hours. Normal same day shipping cut-off time is 1:30pm Pacific time. For example, if you
                        place your order Mon-Fri before 1:30pm Pacific time and all your items are in stock it should ship
                        the same day. However, orders with non-air shipping methods have lower priority over air methods
                        and may not ship the same day if our warehouse is very busy. &nbsp; If you order outside of our operating
                        hours or after 1:30 Mon-Fri, your order will ship the next business day.</p>
                    <h2> Why won't you ship my (large) item using a postal carrier?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> There are many countries with postal package&nbsp;weight and dimensional restrictions. Our website shipping
                        calculator is&nbsp;aware of these restrictions and won't offer options not allowed by your country.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        APO and FPO addresses do cause problems because we have no way of knowing whatthe destination&nbsp;country
                        is so we occasionally get these packages rejected by the post office.</p>
                    <h2> What shipping companies or couriers do you use?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> We primarily use FedEx &amp; USPS.</p>
                    <h2> Can you ship my stuff cheaper?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Maybe but it really depends on what we are shipping.&nbsp; Small shipments (under 50 pounds) really aren't
                        worth shopping around as the savings is small.&nbsp; Bigger shipments could <em>potentially</em>                        save some money using a LTL (pallet) carrier. &nbsp;There are no "slow-boat" options available for
                        small parcels.</p>
                    <h2> Are duties and taxes included in your shipping quotes and charges?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                    No. &nbsp;Taxes and duties are NOT included in shipping charges and may be collected by the carrier upon
                        delivery.</p>
                    <h2> Can you mark the items at a lesser declared value for customs so&nbsp;I can avoid paying taxes and duties?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Nope.&nbsp; You don't stay in business for 50 years by disobeying the law. In order to continue exporting
                        products and avoid fines, we will not break the law. Your tax experience may vary by the method you
                        choose.&nbsp; For example, we have heard from Canadian customers that their postal (mail) carriers
                        sometimes don't bother with import taxes. UPS will always collect taxes.</p>
                    <h2> Do you ship Internationally?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Yes, we ship worldwide daily. See the shipping calculator for available destination countries and rates.</p>
                    <h2> I don't see my country listed as an option in the shipping calculator</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                    There are a few countries that we are restricted from shipping to but you'll need to contact&nbsp;

                    <h2> How long is IPD's warranty and what does it cover?</h2>
                    <p> We warranty products to be free from manufacturing and material defects. &nbsp;Warranty period varies
                        by manufacturer but is typically one year from date of purchase. &nbsp;Warranty period exceptions
                        will be noted on each product page.</p>

                        <li> Warranty is non-transferable and is valid only for the original purchaser of the product.</li>
                        <li>
                        Warranty does not cover any labor or other costs for removal, installation or disposal.</li>
                        <li>
                        Warranty does not cover any expenses or damages resulting from loss of vehicle use.</li>
                        <li> Warranty does not cover parts that have been subjected to abuse, misuse, accidents or modification.</li>

                        <u>branded</u> products have a one year parts warranty.&nbsp; IPD anti-sway bars have a limited life-time

                    <h2> What is IPD's return policy?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> We guarantee your complete satisfaction or you can&nbsp;return the product within 90 days.&nbsp; No refunds
                        on books, digital media (like DVDs) or installed electrical parts. All parts must also be returned
                        with all of the original product packaging to receive a full refund of the original purchase price
                        of the product.&nbsp; Condition of the product packaging must also be in the same condition as which
                        it was received.&nbsp; If you have questions/ concerns about the condition in which you have received
                        a product, please contact our Customer Service Department immediately.</p>
                    <h2> Can I return a product if I change my mind and it has been over 90 days?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                    Yes, but depending on the condition of the product and the current market value, we may not&nbsp;refund
                        you the full purchase price of the product.</p>
                    <h2> Is there a restocking fee?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> After 90 days we may charge a restocking percentage for products that are returned for non-warranty reasons.&nbsp;
                        Items that are not in resaleable condition will also incur a restocking fee.</p>
                    <h2> What is a core charge?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Many rebuilt products have a refundable core charge associated with them.&nbsp; This means that we may
                        be able to credit you for the core if it's in rebuildable condition and you return the old used part
                        in the box we sent you the new one in.</p>
                    <h2> How do I claim a warranty?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The best way to start this process is to contact one of our Customer Service Representatives.</p>
                    <h2>
                    Who pays for shipping on a return?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> This depends on the&nbsp;reason for the return.&nbsp; If we made a mistake we will refund standard ground
                        shipping cost to return the part for exchange or a refund. If you changed your mind or ended up not
                        needing a part and would like to return it, you are responsible for the return shipping cost. To
                        ensure the correct refund amount, please include a note and or receipt showing the return shipping
                        cost</p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                    You will first need to contact our Customer Service Department and get a (RRN) Return Reference Number.
                        They will instruct you on where and how&nbsp;to&nbsp;return product. You can call or email <a href="javascript:location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(115,97,108,101,115,64,105,112,100,117,115,97,46,99,111,109)+'?subject=Customer%20Support'">sales@ipdusa.com</a></p>
                    <h2> Do I really need a Return Reference Number?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> We not not require an RRN but it helps us track your return. &nbsp;We use the RRN to help ensure that
                        your return gets refunded to you.&nbsp; It is amazing how many packages we get back with no documentation
                        or information regarding who sent it to us. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> You can simply write the RRN on the outside of the box and we will know who it came from and why it was
                        returned.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> If you return something without an RRN, please be sure to include a copy of the original invoice or some

                    <h2> How will you credit me back for my return?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> We usually issue in-house credit for returns but in some cases will credit back using the payment method
                        of the original purchase.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2> How long will my return/refund take to process?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> This depends on the nature of the return. A simple returned product is usually credited within a week
                        of it arriving at our warehouse.&nbsp; Warranty credits can take longer depending on the situation
                        (for example shock refunds are dependent upon the manufacturer's evaluation of the failed product.)
                        We make no guarantees on the time required to evaluate returned products.</p>

                        <span id="faq_19">
                    <p> Yes we accept PayPal, but we don't prefer it.</p>
                    <p> <strong>We ship to the address you use during our checkout process and NOT to the address specified in your paypal account.</strong></p>
                    <p> We prefer credit cards to PayPal for a variety of reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> PayPal is a pre-payment method which complicates order cancellations and refunds. Credit cards are
                            a more automated process and require less labor to handle. If you cancel a credit card order,
                            we can simply void an authorization or let it expire, but PayPal requires us to manually refund
                            your money.</li>
                        <li> PayPal is a pre-payment method where as we only charge credit cards at the time of product shipment
                            (or pick-up.)</li>
                        <li> Back orders are a gray area with PayPal.&nbsp; According to the Federal Trade Commission rules&nbsp;we
                            are not supposed to hold a customer's money for more than 30 days without supplying product.&nbsp;
                            Since&nbsp;PayPal is a pre-paid method (unlike a credit card) this obviously can create some
                            complications.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <span id="faq_10">
                    <p> We authorize your card for the stock we have available at the time of order entry. &nbsp;Typically, back
                        orders are not authorized until the stock becomes available.&nbsp;In some cases the entire order
                        gets authorized.</p>
                    <p> Authorization means&nbsp;that we placed a hold on the funds but haven't actually captured them yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        This means the money is "held" or reserved for the merchant that did the authorization.&nbsp; It
                        doesn't mean that you've actually been charged yet. See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_hold"
                            target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_hold</a>&nbsp;for more information about
                        credit card processing.</p>
                    <p> Your funds are captured when we actually ship the&nbsp;products. &nbsp;This means that when&nbsp;our
                        shipping system confirms shipment, our order entry system collects funds against the prior credit
                        card authorization. This is when you are actually charged for the products.</p>
                    <p> You may cancel your order any time before it ships and your card won't be charged.&nbsp; Usually any
                        credit card authorizations are voided at this point but depending on your credit card company, you
                        may need to wait for the authorization to expire to have access to that "held" money.</p>
                    <p> 95% of the credit card companies in the world hold card authorizations for 5-7 days.&nbsp; There are
                        a few that hold them longer.</p>

                        we don't currently have in stock is available to ship to you within a few days. We list lead times

                    <p>Our website shows purchase order estimated arrival times, but that does not guarantee we will have stock
                        available for new orders by that date.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may only have enough product coming in to satisfy
                        the current demand.&nbsp; If you really want the product, we recommend you place an order for it
                        so we know there is demand and can get the appropriate quantities coming from our supplier. We will
                        notify you if the item will be back ordered and you can always cancel your order.&nbsp; You don't
                        need to worry about us holding on to your money because we never charge your credit card until the
                        product actually ships.</p>

                        aftermarket parts, the spirit of the law is that warranty coverage cannot be denied simply because
                        such parts are present on the vehicle, or have been used. <strong><font color="#ff0000">The warranty coverage can be denied only if the aftermarket part caused the malfunction or damage for which warranty coverage is sought.</font></strong>                        Disputes in this area usually boil down to arguments over facts and technical opinions, rather than
